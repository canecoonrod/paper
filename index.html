      <p> An Examination of the Final Chapter of Limbo Through the Perspectives of Fictional Characters </p>
    <p> "If the doors of perception were cleansed, every thing would appear to man as it is: infinite." This quote from 
      William Blake’s circa 1790 work “The Marriage of Heaven and Hell” is one that I believe best accurately represents
      my thoughts during my experience with Limbo, a sidescrolling indie game developed by Playdead. As I tredged along 
      the seemingly endless predestined path, riddled 
      with numerous puzzles of increasing difficulty, I began to cogitate on most of everything that I saw. The final
      scene of the game was one that I found myself thinking about over and over again, as it's ambiguity does no favors
      for my curious mind. The way the child's eyes flicker out when he breaks through the glass at the end, the fact 
      that the child blinks awake just as he did at the beginning of the game, yet there was no cutaway or respawn to 
      signify an actual death, or how the game ends when the child finally gets close to what he was looking for the 
      entire game are all things I found my mind wandering back to.  After contemplating many different theories, using
      the philosophy of those that I had studied prior to writing this, I went crazy with how many 
      things in the game I could get to make sense. Like any other human being though, I decided to check and see what 
      the fanbase of the game thinks the ending means.  </p>
    <p>    After scrolling through hours of Limbo related reddit posts, clicking links to different articles related to
      deciphering the ending scene, I found myself seeing through the lenses of others, with many of their theories 
      actually making sense depending on what perspective they were coming from. After this information binge I had
      subjected myself to, I began to wonder how close any of these theories were to the intentions of the developer. 
      Then, I wonder, would learning the meaning of the developers perspective actually make any of the other theories
      less credible? While the developers are obviously well articulated in the world of philosophy, due to the nature 
      of the game and the title itself, I'm certain they did not prepare for each and every second of audio to be 
      dissected and examined through a visualizer, complimented with a deep dive into an asset the size of an insect 
      searching for a shred of sense in the world they created. It also might be in your perspective to say that the 
      developers did intend for us to dissect the game as much as we have. This realization of the subjectivity of 
      truth led me to wonder what the ending of Limbo would be like from a perspective that is not my own, yet told 
      through my words. In this article, I will be analyzing the ending of Limbo through the personal philosophies of different fictional characters.
      Below are the assets I will be referencing throughout.

    <p>The first character that comes to mind when thinking of this game would be Solomon from the film, Gummo, Directed by Harmony Korine.</p>

      <p> Solomon lives in the fictional town of Xenia Ohio, which was ravaged by a tornado killing many of the people living in it. Solomon is a little boy, 
        like our protagonist in Limbo, who witnessed the brutal destruction of his hometown. He continues to live there afterwards, killing stray cats to the local 
        grocer for milkshake money. Throughout the film, which features many disgusting settings, Solomon is constantly able to find humor and beauty in many things 
        that aren't so. "My neighbor was killed in that house. He used to ride bikes and three-wheelers. They never found his head. I always thought that was funny. 
        Lots of people died to the great tornado." Just like this quote from solomon in the film, Limbo invites us to explore the dark parts of humanity with a different
        perspective.
