      <p> An Examination of the Final Chapter of Limbo Through the Perspectives of Fictional Characters </p>
    <p> "If the doors of perception were cleansed, every thing would appear to man as it is: infinite." This quote from 
      William Blake’s circa 1790 work “The Marriage of Heaven and Hell” is one that I believe best accurately represents
      my thoughts during my experience with Limbo, a sidescrolling indie game developed by Playdead. As I tredged along 
      the seemingly endless predestined path, riddled 
      with numerous puzzles of increasing difficulty, I began to cogitate on most of everything that I saw. The final
      scene of the game was one that I found myself thinking about over and over again, as it's ambiguity does no favors
      for my curious mind. The way the child's eyes flicker out when he breaks through the glass at the end, the fact 
      that the child blinks awake just as he did at the beginning of the game, yet there was no cutaway or respawn to 
      signify an actual death, or how the game ends when the child finally gets close to what he was looking for the 
      entire game are all things I found my mind wandering back to.  After contemplating many different theories, using
      the philosophy of those that I had studied prior to writing this, I went crazy with how many 
      things in the game I could get to make sense. Like any other human being though, I decided to check and see what 
      the fanbase of the game thinks the ending means.  </p>
    <p>    After scrolling through hours of Limbo related reddit posts, clicking links to different articles related to
      deciphering the ending scene, I found myself seeing through the lenses of others, with many of their theories 
      actually making sense depending on what perspective they were coming from. After this information binge I had
      subjected myself to, I began to wonder how close any of these theories were to the intentions of the developer. 
      Then, I wonder, would learning the meaning of the developers perspective actually make any of the other theories
      less credible? While the developers are obviously well articulated in the world of philosophy, due to the nature 
      of the game and the title itself, I'm certain they did not prepare for each and every second of audio to be 
      dissected and examined through a visualizer, complimented with a deep dive into an asset the size of an insect 
      searching for a shred of sense in the world they created. It also might be in your perspective to say that the 
      developers did intend for us to dissect the game as much as we have. This realization of the subjectivity of 
      truth led me to wonder what the ending of Limbo would be like from a perspective that is not my own, yet told 
      through my words. In this article, I will be analyzing the ending of Limbo through the personal philosophies of different fictional characters.
      Below are the assets I will be referencing throughout.

    <p>The first character that comes to mind when thinking of this game would be Solomon from the film, Gummo, Directed by Harmony Korine.</p>

      <p> Solomon lives in the fictional town of Xenia Ohio, which was ravaged by a tornado killing many of the people living in it. Solomon is a little boy, 
        like our protagonist in Limbo, who witnessed the brutal destruction of his hometown. He continues to live there afterwards, killing stray cats to the local 
        grocer for milkshake money. Throughout the film, which features many disgusting settings, Solomon is constantly able to find humor and beauty in many things 
        that aren't so. "My neighbor was killed in that house. He used to ride bikes and three-wheelers. They never found his head. I always thought that was funny. 
        Lots of people died to the great tornado." Just like this quote from solomon in the film, Limbo invites us to explore some very dark moments with a different
        perspective than usual. For example, the scoring in limbo isn't particularly inviting. It isn't very melodic, with many moments of the music being composed of 
        noises from moving machinery. This machinery has patterns through its clanging and clacking though, leading your brain to follow along as if it were a hardcore 
        heavy metal track. Particularly through the song above, for most of the machinery first half you can hear a repeated clash as if someone were banging hard on some 
        cymbals, but the pattern never falters and continues to stay on beat. Heavy metal for instance, which makes up most of the gummo soundtrack, isn't a genre that 
        most would use the term beautiful to describe, but a rocking riff or baseline makes us feel as good as listening to a beautifully played sonata on the piano. 
        As you can see in the image, The track goes from extremely loud, rythmic clanging to soft, heavenly chords in the blink of an eye. The transition from something so jarringly 
        intense to something so melodic was extremely satisfying in game, especially since this happens right as soon as you are
        approaching the spot where the boy jumps, and is ricocheted back into the glass. Solomon would say that it represents the beauty of life and its many different situations, how 
        easily the world can flip from one truth to another. </p>
     
      <p>
        Thinking about the words of Solomon, I think he would find it 
        particularly funny that the boy that almost falls to his death narrowly avoids it by a seemingly divine intervetion. "Life is beautiful. Really, it is. Full of beauty
        and illusions. Life is great. Without it, you'd be dead." Is another one of my favorite quotes from solomon that accurately portrays his feelings towards most things. 
        When the boy falls and is pulled back up, this would be one of those illustrious things that solomon is referencing. There are some things in life 
        that you just cant explain, and life is full of them. All that you can do is sit back and enjoy it. Both Solomon and the boy really have no reaction 
        to the brutal things around them other than the sense of childlike innocence. The boy in limbo shows no emotion, he just continues to move onward.
        They have no representation for the value of an actual life, just that sometimes things 
        happen, and you have to keep going forward no matter what, because if not you would simply stop. I think using this quote, one can observe that maybe the boy did die while breaking
        through the barrier; but the constant will to keep going because of the call to preserve the beauty of life was enough to bring the light back into his eyes. As a child the 
        world is bigger than your imagination, and everytime you see something new is a confirmation that there is something more to see. The sense of discovery is something that even we 
        feel when traversing through some of our favorite video game worlds. As we reach the end, when the boy approaches his sister, there is a ladder on the top right signifying that this 
        is not the end of the journey. This is just one of those wonderful things that life gives you, so that you may continue until one day the path stops. The girl's eyes aren't glowing as his 
        are though, so this may signify that the girl is older, or has lost the sense of imagination and discovery. Just as kids are dependent on companionship, maybe his sister is lost and alone,
        and was waiting for her reminder that life is beautiful. We may never know, as the scene cuts away as soon as the girl realizes the boy is there.

      <p>The second character I think of when it comes to a strong personal philosophy is Rev. Ernst Toller from First Reformed, directed by Paul Schrader </p>
       <img src="fr.png"
           width="400"
  height="300" >
      
      <p> Rev. Ernst Toller is a preacher in a small town in upstate New York, who was approached by an environmental activist questioning what God has called
        for us to do in times when humans are destroying his creation. What follows is an examination on personal responsibility and courage, told through the 
        eyes of a deeply spiritual individual. "Courage is the solution to despair, reason provides no answers. I can't know what the future will bring; we have to
        choose despite uncertainty. Wisdom is holding two contradictory truths in our mind, simultaneously, Hope and despair. A life without despair is a life 
        without hope. Holding these two ideas in our head is life itself." This quote from Rev. Toller on the idea of what life itself is, seems to resonate with me 
        especially during the last moments of the game. If you take a look at the video above, your character finally gets to the end of the road. All there is left to
        do by the end of the game is to seemingly jump to your death. To take the words of Toller literally, for the entirety of the game everything around you has been in despair.
        People locked inside of cages, being hung, hunted by creatures, there is no lack of despair around our character. The solution to this despair is to have the courage to 
        continue onward, to answer the call to step forward in the face of uncertainty. I believe Rev. Toller would say that the glowing eyes on our character represents being 
        enlightened, on the mission to "answer the call" so to speak, in this case the call of God himself. "Some are called for their gregariousness, some are called for their suffering. 
        Others are called for their loneliness." Toller would say that the plunge into darkness is having complete faith in 
        the ideals of hope and dispair, having courage to trust the way forward and accept that there is no way to reason around it. The pull back, shattering through the barrier and 
        losing the light in your eyes could be losing yourself in the search for meaning, or getting to a dead end and losing your way, in turn losing your faith as well. For awhile you
        lay flat and motionless, waiting for the spark of courage to reignite the light in your eyes. You then get back up, and resume the quest. </p>
      
      <p> Through the entirety of the game though, we are fairly uncertain on what this quest actually is. After reawakening, or reenlightenment, you find yourself stepping up towards
        a figure that is sitting on their knees on top of a hill. Their eyes are dark though, not lit like the boy. "Every act of preservation is an act of creation. Everything preserved 
        renews creation. It's how we participate in creation." This quote from Toller explains what the call from God is, which is to participate in creation by preservation. 
        In relation to Limbo, could this mean the preservation of the courage to face despair? We know that our protagonist is the only creature with glowing eyes, moving forever 
        onward towards a goal that we have no real confirmation of. As I referenced in the argument of Solomon, there is a ladder leading up to somewhere at the end scene. Is the 
        call asking them both to move onward? In these moments I believe Toller would say that the call was to spread the power of enlightenment to as many creatures living in 
        this dying world, so that they can continue to answer the call of God to preserve what little bit of humanity is left. This would mean that the boy could inspire the girl,
        causing them both to go forward and be the change that continues creation. At some point Toller points out that humanity is constantly surrounded by terrible things, with 
        youth being exposed to an incredible amount of things that kids shouldn't be, basically halting the preservation of functionality and righteousness in society. This can be compared 
        to how the child in Limbo witnesses many terrible things and is seemingly desensitized to all the things around him. In Rev. Toller's perspective, Limbo would be a game based on 
        the functionality and preservation of courage in the face of despair. </p>
