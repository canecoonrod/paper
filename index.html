    <p> "If the doors of perception were cleansed, every thing would appear to man as it is: infinite." This quote from 
      William Blake’s circa 1790 work “The Marriage of Heaven and Hell” is one that I believe best accurately represents
      my thoughts during my experience with Limbo. As I tredged along the seemingly endless predestined path, riddled 
      with numerous puzzles of increasing difficulty, I began to cogitate on most of everything that I saw. The final
      scene of the game was one that I found myself thinking about over and over again, as it's ambiguity does no favors
      for my curious mind. The way the child's eyes flicker out when he breaks through the glass at the end, the fact 
      that the child blinks awake just as he did at the beginning of the game, yet there was no cutaway or respawn to 
      signify an actual death, or how the game ends when the child finally gets close to what he was looking for the 
      entire game are all things I found my mind wandering back to.  After contemplating many different theories, using
      the philosophy of those that I had studied prior to writing this, I began to go absolutely nuts with how many 
      things in the game I could get to make sense. Like any other human being though, I decided to check and see what 
      the fanbase of the game thinks the ending means.  </p>
    <p>    After scrolling through hours of Limbo related reddit posts, clicking links to different articles related to
      deciphering the ending scene, I found myself seeing through the lenses of others, with many of their theories 
      actually making sense depending on what perspective they were coming from. After this information binge I had
      subjected myself to, I began to wonder how close any of these theories were to the intentions of the developer. 
      Then, I wonder, would learning the meaning of the developers perspective actually make any of the other theories
      less credible? While the developers are obviously well articulated in the world of philosophy, due to the nature 
      of the game and the title itself, I'm certain they did not prepare for each and every second of audio to be 
      dissected and examined through a visualizer, complimented with a deep dive into an asset the size of an insect 
      searching for a shred of sense in the world they created. It also might be in your perspective to say that the 
      developers did intend for us to dissect the game as much as we have. This realization of the subjectivity of 
      truth led me to wonder what the ending of Limbo would be like from a perspective that is not my own, yet told 
      through my words. In other words, test my understanding of the perception of others by deciphering the ending of 
      Limbo through the personal philosophies of different characters. Below are the assets I will be referencing 
      throughout the article.

      <p> Above audio, visualized </p>
      
    
    <p>This audio is taken directly from the soundtrack once you get into the part where all of the mechanisms behind your character appear to be making noises.
      Firstly, I'd like to say that this audio clip felt vaguely familiar during my first playthough. All of the clanging and machine burring and things of that
      nature gave the world some life, as if it were supposed to signify that this world isn't completely abandoned, but is in fact some other sort of universe 
      or world. The familiarity finally became clear after showing my roomate David Lynch's Eraserhead this weekend. At the beginning of the movie it shows you
      that the world is in fact different from our own. Followed by streets that are completely empty, with no other person in sight, our protagonist walks alone
      in a world that visually could be percieved as abandoned and empty. The sound design is filled with contant metal clanging and operating machinery though, 
      which leads the viewer to further build a narrative about that world. Limbo does the exact same thing here, filling the game with machinery and clanging 
      noises that let you know you are not alone, but also aren't relatively safe. These are details that add to the tory of the game, but you completely overlook
      because it is just noise. In conclusion, all of these small details are what give the game it's narration.
